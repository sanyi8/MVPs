Here’s a prompt you can give to Replit’s AI Agent to fix the **"Invalid task data"** error related to the missing or incorrect `position` field, and ensure your **DoIt** app’s add and list functions work properly:

### Prompt to fix task add error and make DoIt MVP fully functional:

---

**Fix the React Native Expo DoIt app so that when adding a task:**

- The task object includes a required numeric `position` property representing its order in the list.  
- When a new task is added, assign it a `position` value that places it at the end of the active tasks list.  
- Ensure the `position` field is updated correctly when tasks are reordered via drag-and-drop.  
- Modify the add task function to validate input and include `position` before saving the task.  
- Fix the list display so tasks are sorted by `position` ascending.  
- Make sure the done and later buttons update the task lists and positions properly without errors.  
- Confirm all confirmation dialogs work as expected and tasks move between active, done, and later states correctly.  
- Use React state hooks for managing tasks and positions in memory.  
- Provide a working example of the main components (MainScreen, AddModal, ListModal) with these fixes.

Please generate the updated React Native code for this MVP app with these fixes applied and test that the add, list, done, and later features work without errors.

### Explanation for the fix:

The error you got:

```
400: {"message":"Invalid task data","errors":[{"code":"invalid_type","expected":"number","received":"undefined","path":["position"],"message":"Required"}]}
```

means the backend or state expects every task to have a numeric `position` field (used for ordering), but your add function is not providing it when creating a new task.

By assigning `position` as the last index (e.g., current max position + 1) when adding a task, and updating positions on reorder, you prevent this error.
