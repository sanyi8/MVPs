**Purpose:** Multi-zodiac personality app that generates six different astrology insights based on your birth details.  
Summarises results according to user preferences — turning astrology into an interactive, personalised experience.

### 🧠 Summary
CosmoX blends **AI reasoning** with **zodiac logic** to give users a multidimensional view of their personality.  
Instead of a single horoscope, it analyses multiple systems (Western, Chinese, Numerology, etc.) and fuses them into one concise summary.  

Each result aims for **self-awareness and personal growth**, wrapped in a clean, mobile-first UI built for quick interaction.

Part of my **AI + Low-Code MVP collection** — each project was built and refined in **Replit**, usually in less than a day, to test automation and product ideas fast.
